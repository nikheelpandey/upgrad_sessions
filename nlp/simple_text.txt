The home side struck twice early in the morning session, leaving them 182 runs behind and with just two more wickets to get, with CricViz giving them a 47 per cent of winning the match at that point.

But when Root brought speedster Mark Wood into the attack, set fielders back on the rope and seemingly attempted to bounce out tail enders Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, the match turned in India's favour.

England's tactics, particularly to Bumrah, were seemingly in response to the Indian quick's own short-ball assault to Jimmy Anderson late on day three, which drew the ire of the English veteran.
